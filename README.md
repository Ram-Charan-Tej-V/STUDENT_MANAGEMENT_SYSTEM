# STUDENT_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
## Description:
	
 Developed a Student Management System using Java technologies (JDBC, Servlets, JSP) following the 
	MVC design pattern. The system will provide a user-friendly interface for admin login, data entry, 
	storage in a JDBC database, and display of student details in a table format.
## Features:
### Login Page:
 1. Create a simple login page for admin to enter their credentials (e.g., username and password).
 2. Implement authentication to ensure only authorized admins can access the system.
### Student Details Form (JSP):
 1. Design a JSP page with a form to capture student details, including fields such as Name,
   Roll Number, Course, and Grade.
 2. Ensure proper validation for the form inputs to maintain data integrity.
### Servlets (Controller):
 1. Implement a servlet acting as the controller to handle requests from the JSP pages.
 2. Use the servlet to process login requests, validate user credentials.
### DAO Layer (Data Access Object):
 1. Develop a DAO layer to interact with the database.
 2. Include methods to insert student details into the database and retrieve student information for 
  display.
### JDBC Database:
 1. Set up a relational database (e.g., MySQL) to store student information.
 2. Create a table to store student details with appropriate columns (e.g., ID, Name, Roll Number, 
  Course, Grade).
### Insertion of Student Details:
 1. Upon form submission, use the servlet to capture the entered data.
 2. Call the DAO layer to insert the student details into the database.
### Display Students in Table Format (JSP):
 1. Create a JSP page to display student information in a Table format.
 2. Retrieve data.
### MVC Design Pattern:
  Follow the MVC design pattern with clear separation of concerns.
  1. Model: Represent the student data structure and database interactions in the DAO layer.
  2. View: Use JSP pages for the user interface.
  3. Controller: Implement servlets to manage the flow of data between the view and the model.
### Exception Handling:
 1. Implement proper exception handling throughout the application to manage errors gracefully.
 2. Display meaningful error messages to users in case of any issues.
 ### Conclusion:
This Student Management System project will provide a hands-on experience in building a web application using Java technologies and 
the MVC design pattern. It covers essential aspects such as user authentication, data validation, database interactions, and data display.
